# Projectile Motion Simulation Projects

This repository contains three different versions of a projectile motion simulation implemented in Python. Each version calculates and visualizes the trajectory of a projectile launched with a specified velocity and angle. The simulations aim to hit a target, and they differ in terms of code structure and approach.

## First Code (BirinciKod.py)
- Simulates projectile motion with basic calculations.
- Utilizes functions for horizontal and vertical velocities, flight time, and range.
- Displays trajectories for multiple attempts and checks if the target is hit.

## Second Code (IkinciKod.py)
- Enhances code organization with separate functions for calculations.
- Visualizes projectile trajectories with improved clarity.
- Incorporates target hit checks using calculated range.

## Third Code (UcuncuKod.py)
- Introduces an advanced simulation structure.
- Implements functions for velocity components, flight time, and range calculations.
- Provides detailed trajectory plots and target hit assessment.

## Usage
1. Adjust the parameters in each script, such as initial velocity and launch angle.
2. Run the scripts to visualize projectile trajectories and target hit outcomes.
3. Review the plotted trajectories and console outputs for each version.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to understand the effects of different parameters on the projectile motion simulations.
